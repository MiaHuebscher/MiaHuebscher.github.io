This code was produced during a semester-long group project for the course, "Information Presentation and Visualization". It generates a website containing several
interactive visualizations intended to help the Mass Ave Coalition in Boston convince residents to utilize greener transportation modes. During this project, I led my 
teammates by designing the project idea and goal, assigning and managing tasks, researching HTML and CSS to customize the webpage, writing the text for each section
of the website, and constructing three of the four interactive visualizations through the use of Tableau and the Vega-Altair and Plotly visualizations libraries.
