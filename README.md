This code was produced during a semester-long group project for the course, "Information Presentation and Visualization". It generates a website containing several
interactive visualizations intended to help the Mass Ave Coalition in Boston convince residents to utilize greener transportation modes. During this project, I led my 
teammates by designing the project idea and goal, assigning and managing tasks, researching HTML and CSS to customize the webpage, writing the text for each section
of the website, and constructing three of the four interactive visualizations through the use of Tableau and the Vega-Altair and Plotly visualizations libraries. I also found, cleaned, and merged two additional data sets to help in our analysis and presentation.

To see the three visualizations I produced for this project, you can open the "Visualizations Code" file of the repository. Utilziing Vega-Altair and Plotly, respectively, I produced the "FinalViz1.ipynb" and "complaints_sankey.ipynb" files. These files are also available as html files in the folder for easier access. 
On our website, these visualizations are under the titles, "The Effect of Various Commute Types on Air and Noise Pollution in Boston" and "Sankey Diagram Mapping Neighborhoods to Complaints Regarding Parked Vehicles, Abandoned Vehicles, and the Flow of Traffic", respectively. Under the title "Locations of Noise Disturbances Regarding Automobiles Reported Around Massachusetts Avenue" resides the visualization I produced utilizing Tableau.

Below are demonstrations illustrating the functionality of my interactive visualizations:
