If this involves residential trash pickup  this should go to PWD and if this involves commercial trash pickup (since from the map I see there is a commercial building across the street)  there is not much the APCC can do because the State of Massachusetts does not allow cities and municipalities to regulate the hours of commercial trash pickups.

Since not much was mentioned about it  this one may be related to commercial trash pickup and there's not much the APCC can do about that because the state of Massachusetts does not allow municipalities to regulate the hours of commercial trash pickups.  Especially in the Backbay area  where it would be an issue/violation with Code Enforcement.  Also the public works does not allow residential trash pickups before 6am.

According to the receptionist  the school custodian does have no control over the hours of the dumpster pickup time and this concern should be forwarded to the BPS Engineering Department.  I also contacted the Engineering Department and left a voice message for the Facilities Director so he could address the issue with the contractor.  Next time  this type of complaint comes in  please forward them to the BPS Facilities and Engineering Department.

A Police detail was called for this job.     Sometimes  the details are not filled  or a Police officer is up the street      Unfortunately in this case  the detail was not filled.     The PWD has reached out to the Boston Police about the need to fill the detail requests    The patch is now smooth and level    We apologize for the inconvenience   For any questions or concerns  please contact the number listed below    Sincerely     Mark Cardarelli  Supervisor of Utility Coordination and Compliance  Boston Public Works Department  617-635-4951 Office   ,Public Works Department,Highway Maintenance,Work Hours-Loud Noise Complaints,PWDx,,3,3,Dorchester,7,125 Savin Hill Ave,2125.0,42.3113,-71.0533,Constituent Call

Closed date : 2020-03-16 09:07:34.373 Case Resolved Dear Constituent     The Boston Public Works Construction Inspection Unit (CIU) investigated and determined the following:    National Grid is replacing a gas main that is over 100 years old.    In addition to replacing a 100 year old main National Grid is replacing every gas service to each resident/business.      The City highly encourages this type of work. It will eliminate possible future emergency leak repairs.       Especially if we plan on paving the street in the future.    The City acknowledges that the construction will cause an inconvenience to the residents.    However replacing mains over 100 years old ensures solid dependable gas service for another 100 years.     Again the City apologizes for the inconvenience this necessary work has caused.
